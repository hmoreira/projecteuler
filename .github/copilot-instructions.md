# Project Euler .NET Solutions

This workspace is designed for solving Project Euler mathematical problems using C#/.NET.

## Project Structure
- Individual problem solutions organized by problem number in separate branches
- Console applications for each problem with simple structure
- One C# file per problem with clear documentation

## Coding Guidelines
- Use clear, readable variable names
- Include problem description as comments
- Optimize for both readability and performance
- Keep solutions simple and focused

## Problem Solving Approach
- Read and understand the problem thoroughly
- Plan the algorithm before coding
- Start with a brute force solution, then optimize
- Test with provided examples before submitting

## Workflow
- Each problem lives in its own Git branch (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
- Use `new-problem.bat {number}` to create new problem structure
- Work on solution in isolation, then commit to branch
- Simple `dotnet run` execution model
